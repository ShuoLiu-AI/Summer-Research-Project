1)practice 1: thermal simulation in ABAQUS with 2D single high-abosorbing mineral particle surrounded by a low-abosorbing material
2)practice 2: EM field modelling and convertion the filed to thermal field
3)investigation: EM field modelling and thermal simulation based on many 3D multi-particles 
4)investigation: EM field modelling and thermal simulation on face aborbing of rock mass, to simulate the insite senarior when assisting a tunneling
